## **Expectations**
We would like to get an analysis on people's taste of music, a clear visualization on the "tribes/clusters" of music listeners, and possibly a recommendation algorithm based on the way we have classified people's taste. We would like to find out the prominent features that make the decision between one taste to the other and what it takes for a music piece to be more popular than the other.
