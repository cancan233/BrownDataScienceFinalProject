## **Expectations**

We would like to get an analysis on how censorship affects the listening habits of a user and how this is controlled by predictors like user information and ocuntry indexes/ranking. For example, are younger people more willing to use the Internet as a resource to go around censorship when the content involves music? The [LFM-1b dataset](http://www.cp.jku.at/datasets/LFM-1b/) collected from Last FM is utilized for the country/age/listening habits of the user. The evaluation of freedom is extracted from international organizations like Freedom House or the World Bank.
